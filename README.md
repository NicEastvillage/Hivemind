# Hivemind

Hivemind bots for [RLBot](rlbot.org).

Currently supported languages:

- Python
- Rust

## Quick test

Clone this repository and run `runner.py`. It should run a match with a Python Hivemind versus a Rust Hivemind. The bots will just spin in circles, but you should see `Running!` and `I am alive! Team: #` in the console.
